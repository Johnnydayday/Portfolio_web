        <h4>DESIGN</h4>
        <p>A full calendar (14 sheets including concept page and the cover) design project is ideal to comprehend and practice visual system. There are 14 sheets of visual system graphics --- Each month, from January to December, to utilize a kit of visual systems, and show an organic relationship between each month. The visual system project may include syntactic design or semantic design. In all cases the final project is to present an aesthetic value and quality. Functional elements of a calendar (days of the week or months of the year) may be limited if needed. This is because wall-calendars emphasize graphics rather than their function in these days. Finally, there will be a box or package to contain the 14 calendar sheets based on visual design of the calendar.</p>

        <h4>IDEA</h4>
        <p>Cities in this world are different, they look different, and they represented distinct cultures. Cities kept attracting tourists from the world. I found myself very interested in cities, and cities have lots of perspectives. I believe from different perspectives, one can come up with different interpretations about the city. On the one hand, cities are hubs of complexity --- Buildings, bridges, roads, etc., that

            one intersect another to make a whole of order or chaos. On the other hand, by a glance of cities, their forms are very simple., which produces a systematic visual effect that every city is just made of layers and blocks. Hence, my idea is about to represent cities in different perspectives with gird systems, regardless of their names but the pure abstractions out of the order and complexity.</p>

        <i>Ideas and Draft</i>
     </div>


     <div>
         <h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
         <p>The calendar design under the concept of Cities and Perspective consists of 12 sheets of monthly design, additional cover and package are also included. In terms of visual construction, the design adopts a dynamic grid system that directed by straight lines across each artboard to demonstrate a viewing angle of a city. Then, gradient color layers are to illustrate the abstract appearance of cities. To enhance the visual impacts, each design also utilized grainy effects, transparency, and color halftone to add an extra depth of texture to the design. The rest of the elements that build up the calendar concerned with the design layout and typography. Thinking about the function, usefulness of a calendar - it’s about telling the time and events. Whether is a Monday or Friday; whether it is a workday or a holiday; So I thought to group date by associated events, for instance, Monday occupies the 5th, 12th, 19th and 26th day of January. In terms of typography, I chose Optima, a san-serif typeface, which I believe also captures the elegance of serif typefaces as the display typeface for numbers and days. I also used EloquentJFPro, a serif typeface that displays heavy font-weight and delivers extreme emphasizes on characters’ ascenders, descenders, and terminals so to conjure a hierarchy among the textual contents, and I believe such a typeface could direct viewers’ attention to focus on what’s essential.</p>

   </div>

     <div>
         <h4>PACKAGE DESIGN</h4>
         <p>The package design is to design an envelope for wrapping and protecting the caleander sheets, also the package should provide users with a delightful expeirnece for unboxing. So, I designed the evelope like a full package for the calendar, with a handle lock in the back and a full image of the theme on the front. By lightly lift the handle lock, the package opens up itself, and present the calendar with a ribbon, slightly lift the ribbon the hidden back stand will present the calendar to the auidence.   </p>
