            <h1>Motivation Design UX in Language Learning Apps</h1>
            <i style="margin-left: 0;">A Comparative study about "Duolingo" and "Hello Talk" in active-user acquisition and retainment.</i>
            <h5>Time: 2019,4; Team work with Kim Hanna</h5>
           <p>Using language learning apps has been said to be beneficial to learners' speaking pronunciation(Agnes Kukulska-Hulme, 2012), vocabulary acquisition (Steel Caroline, 2012), sociolinguistic competence (Kerstin Borau, Carsten Ullrich, Jinjin Feng, Ruimin Shen, 2009)." Our investigation is specifically in the field of Mobile Aided Language Learning (MALL), and we have chosen the language learning apps "Duolingo" and "HelloTalk" to study their user experience design, and to find out the effectiveness of its "motivation design" in improving users' language proficiency. Our study 1 emphasizes on the methods of conducting interviews with current users of Duolingo and HelloTalk. By collecting qualitative data, we were able to find users’ usage, experience, feeling, and many other aspects toward Duolingo and HelloTalk.  Our study 2 implements online survey and follow- up interviews, which not only helped us to reveal users’ usage, attitudes, intents, feedback and opinions on the respective applications , but also helped us with utilizing the insights from the interviews in study 1 and applying it to the general public. The major results have shown that in Duolingo, the initial purpose of using ranking, achievement, competition to motivate users to stay long-term and active is quite insignificant to many users. Instead, pop-up notifications and email were seen to be the real motivator. As for HelloTalk, the community-based motivation design seemed effective in retaining users, however, the focus of learning languages and a sense of belonging to the community  were reported to be controversial.
